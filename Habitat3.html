<h2 style="color:Gray;">Bottlenose Dolphin</h2>
<blockquote cite style="color:DimGray;">Blue whales are able to breathe air, but they are very comfortable in the ocean waters where buoyancy helps to support their incredible bulk. These mammals are found in all the world's oceans and often swim in small groups or alone.</blockquote>

<h2 style="color:Gray;">Sea Lions</h2>
<blockquote cite style="color:DimGray;">California sea lions live on the western coast of North America from the Baja California peninsula in Mexico to British Columbia. These semi-aquatic mammals feed on fish, squid, and shellfish. They are generally found in open water, where they prefer to fish, but are sometimes found in rivers near the coast as well.</blockquote>
